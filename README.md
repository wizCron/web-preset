# web-preset

A minimal React + TypeScript starter preset using Vite and Tailwind CSS.

This repository provides a lightweight, ready-to-use project scaffold with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite for fast local development. It's intended as a base for building component libraries, small apps, or prototypes.

## Features

- Vite for fast development and build
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling

## Manual

Prerequisites: Node.js (16+ recommended) and npm installed.

1. Install project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Install the Tailwind CSS animate utilities (optional, used by some components):

```
npm install tailwindcss-animate
```

3. Start the Vite development server:

```
npm run dev
```

After the server starts, open the address shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:5173) to view the app.

## Useful commands

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Install tailwind animate: `npm install tailwindcss-animate`
- Run dev server: `npm run dev`
- Build for production: `npm run build` (if available in project scripts)

## Notes

If you add Tailwind plugins or additional utilities, update `tailwind.config.ts` and `postcss.config.js` as needed.

Enjoy building!
